# epoch_submission
This is my task submission for epoch core selections
Task_1: Here i learnt to implememt k-means clustering from scratch as well as plotting longitudes and latitudes on a map using cartopy.
Task_2: I got a deeper understanding of CNNs and image segmentation using CV. I had a lot of fun trying to isolate the character images, then making them be in an order
and also handling the spacing, it took time to figure out stuff but im happy with the results.
